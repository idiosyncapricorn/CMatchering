# Audio Mastering App

This is a simple Audio Mastering desktop application built using Python's `Tkinter` library. The app provides a graphical interface for mastering audio and visualizing waveforms. It is based on the [Matchering](https://github.com/sergree/matchering) Python library for reference audio mastering, but it has been converted to **Cython** for improved performance and includes a basic UI built on `Tkinter`.

## Features
- **Mastering Tab:** Includes tools for basic audio mastering functionalities, leveraging the power of the Matchering library.
- **Additional Features Tab:** Allows for waveform plotting and other audio-related functionalities.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (comes with most Python installations)
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-mastering-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd audio-mastering-app
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure to install any additional dependencies needed for `audio_mastering` and `waveform_plotting`.

## Cython Conversion

The core mastering functionality from the Matchering library has been converted to **Cython** for performance optimization. Make sure Cython is installed:

```bash
pip install cython
```

You can compile the Cython modules by running:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script to launch the app:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The application window will open with two tabs:
   - **Mastering:** Tools for mastering audio.
   - **Additional Features:** Tools for waveform plotting and other audio-related functionalities.

### Additional Notes:
- I added a section for compiling Cython code, assuming you have a `setup.py` file for this purpose. If you need help with the Cython setup, feel free to ask!
